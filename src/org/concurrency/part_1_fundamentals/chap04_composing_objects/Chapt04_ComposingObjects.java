/**
 * Chapter 4. Composing Objects
 *
 * We don't want to have to analyze each memory access to ensure that our program is thread-safe;
 * we want to be able to take thread-safe components and safely compose them into larger components or programs.
 * This chapter covers patterns for structuring classes that can make it easier to make them thread-safe
 * and to maintain them without accidentally undermining their safety guarantees.
